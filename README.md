# Cleanup WP `<head>` #
 > Small WordPress plugin to subjectively disable built-in actions and filters.
 
 For my college capstone I created a WordPress-powered site for a client, and the site did not need all the ~~junk~~ extras WordPress
 has built-in so I slapped this thing together. It may change over time based on needs and oninions. I am basically putting it on GitHub
 so I do not lose it once the semester is over.
